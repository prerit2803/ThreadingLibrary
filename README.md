# ThreadingLibrary

Implemented a non pre-emptive user-level threads library mythread.a with the following routines.
## Thread routines.

### MyThread MyThreadCreate (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)
This routine creates a new MyThread. The parameter start_func is the function in which the new thread starts executing. The parameter args is passed to the start function. This routine does not pre-empt the invoking thread. In others words the parent (invoking) thread will continue to run; the child thread will sit in the ready queue. 
### void MyThreadYield(void)
Suspends execution of invoking thread and yield to another thread. The invoking thread remains ready to execute—it is not blocked. Thus, if there is no other ready thread, the invoking thread will continue to execute. 
### int MyThreadJoin(MyThread thread)
Joins the invoking function with the specified child thread. If the child has already terminated, do not block. Note: A child may have terminated without the parent having joined with it. Returns 0 on success (after any necessary blocking). It returns -1 on failure. Failure occurs if specified thread is not an immediate child of invoking thread. 
### void MyThreadJoinAll(void)
Waits until all children have terminated. Returns immediately if there are no active children. 
### void MyThreadExit(void)
Terminates the invoking thread. Note: all MyThreads are required to invoke this function. Do not allow functions to “fall out” of the start function. 

## Semaphore routines.

### MySemaphore MySemaphoreInit(int initialValue)
Create a semaphore. Set the initial value to initialValue, which must be non-negative. A positive initial value has the same effect as invoking MySemaphoreSignal the same number of times. On error it returns NULL. 
### void MySemaphoreSignal(MySemaphore sem)
Signal semaphore sem. The invoking thread is not pre-empted. 
### void MySemaphoreWait(MySemaphore sem)
Wait on semaphore sem. 
### int MySemaphoreDestroy(MySemaphore sem)
Destroy semaphore sem. Do not destroy semaphore if any threads are blocked on the queue. Return 0 on success, -1 on failure. 

Unix process routines.
The Unix process in which the user-level threads run is not a MyThread. Therefore, it will not be placed on the queue of MyThreads. Instead it will create the first MyThread and relinquish the processor to the MyThread engine.

The following routine may be executed only by the Unix process.
### void MyThreadInit (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)
This routine is called before any other MyThread call. It is invoked only by the Unix process. It is similar to invoking MyThreadCreate immediately followed by MyThreadJoinAll. The MyThread created is the oldest ancestor of all MyThreads—it is the “main” MyThread. This routine can only be invoked once. It returns when there are no threads available to run (i.e., the thread ready queue is empty. 

## Invocation

Clone or Download the repositry, Run the Makefile:
```
Make
```
Makefile is designed in such a way that it will create the sufficient files required to make the program work.
Make all the routines available via a library. Use the ar command to make a library. It will be used similar to this:
```
ar rc libmyth.a file1.o file2.o file3.o 
```
All programs that use this library will include a header file (mythread.h) that defines all the interfaces and data structures that are needed—but no more.
Now, running the program:
```
gcc -Wall <example_to_run>.c libmyth.a -o <example_executable>
```
## Additional Info:
Use a FIFO (first-in, first-out) scheduling policy for threads on the ready queue.

This library does not have to be thread-safe and will only execute in a single-threaded (OS) process. Assume that an internal thread operation cannot be interrupted by another thread operation. (E.g., MyThreadExit will not be interrupted by MyThreadYield.) That means that the library does not have to acquire locks to protect the internal data of the thread library. (A user may still have to acquire semaphores to protect user data.)

The interface only allows one parameter (a void *) to be passed to a MyThread. This is sufficient. One can build wrapper functions that pack and unpack an arbitrary parameter list into an object pointed to by a void *. This program gives an example of that. It is not a complete program—some of the logic is absent. It is only provided to illustrate how to use the interface.

Allocate at least 8KB for each thread stack.
